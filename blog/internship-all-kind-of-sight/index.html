<p>My internship was my first exposure to the real world within my field of study. I picked up a confirmed start-up (40 emplpoyees) with a bunch of data scientists and software engineers. I joined the coolest team within the company: the Data Science team. <a href="https://www.np6.co.uk/">NP6</a> aims to help companies with their data activation. Clients such as Cdiscount (french amazon), Alinea (french IKEA) or BricoDépôt (big hardware store) trust NP6 to help them democratizing their data and thus, operate more efficiently through dashboarding and data storage.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I was immediately included in all team meetings, and encouraged to share my opinions. I wasn’t expecting to feel so involved in the current workings and future plans. Laurent made sure that I dove into all the environment and vocabulary from the very early stage. Even though it was a bit scary, I was glade to be stimulated.

<p>Coming straight from school, it&rsquo;s obvious that I discoverd many many news things. From data format to</p>

<p>I was beyond lucky to be able to
I felt trust and supported, extract the best potential out of me
My internship was a true career revelation for me. I can&rsquo;t stress enough how it
It was the revelation I was looking for. I was still not 100% sure if I wanted to spend the rest of my career behind a computer or sailing the world.
I had the best supervisor I could hope to have, and Laurent if you are reading those lines, thank you.</p>
